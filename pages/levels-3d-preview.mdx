# 3D Canvas

<ModuleInfo />
3D Canvas is a module for viewing and creating maps in 3D.

Turn your maps into true 3D, load in 3D models, and play your games in
the glorious third dimension. Supports lighting and animated models. If
you don't have 3D models don't worry! 3D canvas will turn your 2D
tokens into stand-up figures in 3D mode.

For people who want a quick and simple guide to get started with 3D
Canvas, read the [Getting Started](levels-3d-preview/3D-Canvas-Getting-Started) guide.

### Incompatible Modules

There are no known modules that will cause issues.

However, modules that create visual effects in 2D will likely not carry over
effects to 3D. Other types of modules will likely be compatible with 3D Canvas.

## Tools

-   [Terrascape](https://terrascape.theripper93.com/) for sculpting and painting 3D Terrain in an intuitive way

## Controls

While loading into a 3D scene, you will see a pop-up of the basic controls.
It can be closed or re-opened by selecting the **?** button on the left of the
Foundry sidebar. All controls can be rebinded in the configure controls menu.

Actions marked GC are only available when Game Camera is enabled.

    The 3D navigator is a new way for you and your players to navigate the
    3D Scene with ease!

    To have the 3D Navigator show a slider with all it's options, you must
    define Levels in the Levels UI. The navigator will use those names and
    the top range for its clipping planes

    To cut to a specific Level, simply move the slider to the Level you
    prefer, the slider will automatically snap to the closest Level.

    - **Sync**:
    If you are a GM, you will see a Sync button on top of the slider, by pressing
    the button you will sync your current level with all players.
    - **Camera**:
    If you are a Player or GM you will see a Camera button, by pressing it
    the camera will focus on the currently selected token (the same as Shift + X ).
    Doing this will automatically set the navigator to the closest level.
    - **Follow Mode**:
    Click to toggle. Selecting a token or changing elevation will automatically
    set the navigator to the closest level while enabled. It is enabled on scene
    load for players and disabled for GMs by default. You can change this behaviour in the module settings under the misc tab.

          the target for the view, use the ping option (`Shift` + `Q`)
          to set the camera before saving the initial view position.

          **Lock Camera Perspective**

          If you wish to force a certain perspective on this scene, you can lock
          it. The camera will no longer rotate, the angle for the lock is the one
          of the initial view position.
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
          **HDRI**

          If no skybox is selected, the HDRI will be used as the background. if
          both skybox and HDRI are selected, the skybox will be used as the
          background and the HDRI for lighting and reflections. Having and HDRI is
          highly suggested for Metallic and Reflective surfaces to look correct.

          **Skybox Image**

          Set the skybox (or 3D background) for this scene. The file needs to be
          in the same folder of 6 total files, files must contain
          **`_ft`**, **`_bk`**, **`_up`**, **`_dn`**,
          **`_rt`**, or **`_lf`** in their name.

          **Enable Bloom**

          Toggles bloom effects for the scene.

          **Filter**

          Adds filter effects to the scene. Available filters are

          `Greyscale`
          `Sepia`
          `Invert`
          `Contrast`
          `Brightness`
          `Hue`
          `Saturation`
          `Custom`

          Custom will create an input box under filter intensity. You can create
          your custom filter with CSS Filters and the syntax will be the same. See
          the [MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebCSSfilter) on
          CSS Filter for more information.

          **Render Tiles**

          Whether or not to display tiles.

          **Render Scene Lights**

          Whether or not to display lights.

          **Mirror Levels Tile Visibility**

          If enabled 3D Canvas will mirror the Levels tiles visibility. This
          option is required if you want to make a multilevel 3D Map where floors
          above tokens disappear automatically for easier navigation.

          **Use 3D Geometry for sight calculations**

          Instead of mirroring the 2D Canvas token visibility, use the 3D Geometry
          of the scene. This means that if you simply load a 3D Model into the
          scene, it's geometry will be used to block token visibility, meaning you
          do not need to wall the scene and it will just work. This setting also applies to
          [Levels - Volumetric Templates](../levels/levelsvolumetrictemplates)
          Auto Targeting and 3D Cover Calculations.

## Entities in 3D

While most entities will work the same in 3D as they do in 2D, there are some differences that you should be aware of. Especially when dealing with Tiles since they are the most common entity in 3D and can do a lot more than what you are used to in 2D.
For example in 3D we use tiles to create walls, floors, ceilings, and even roofs. Tiles are capable of blocking sight and movement and to be used as doors.
To see details about how to use the various 3D Entities, visit their respective pages. It's suggested to at least read the [Tiles](levels-3d-preview/entities/tiles) page since it's the entity you will be dealing with the most.

## Fog of War

Fog of war works slightly differently in 3D, with the default settings the map will be completely revealed. If you want to know more about how Fog of War works in 3D and it's performance implications and limitations, check the [Fog of War & Vision](levels-3d-preview/fow) page.

## Special Effects

### Shaders

Shaders allow you to create many procedural effects on Tiles, Tokens, Templates and more. From simple color changes to complex effects like water, fire, wind, and ice.
To learn more about how to use Shaders, check the [Shaders](levels-3d-preview/entities/shaders) page.

### Token Animations

#### Start an animation through the UI

You can access the Token Animations by Right clicking your token to open the Token Hud, you will see a Magic Wand icon on the right, click it to open the available animations. Clicking on an animation will play the animation for all clients. Some animations might not work if the token is Prone or Defeated.

#### Start animation with macros

To play an animation with a macro, first create a script macro, then use the following commands to play your desired animation.

```js
game.Levels3DPreview.playTokenAnimation(tokens, animationId, options);
```

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tokens      | This parameter can be a single token object, an array of token objects, a single token ID or an array of token IDs, the animation will play on all these targets. |
| animationId | The identifier for the animation, you can find all the animation IDs by typing `game.Levels3DPreview.CONFIG.tokenAnimations` in the console and hitting Enter.    |
| Options     | This is optional, an object containing additional parameters                                                                                                      |

```js
{
  repeats: 1, // How many times you want the animation to play
  resetTime: milliseconds, // Force the time that the animation takes to reset to the original position once it ends
}
```

#### Example Macro

This macro will play the Twirl animation, 3 Times, on all Selected Tokens

```js
game.Levels3DPreview.playTokenAnimation(canvas.tokens.controlled, "twirl", {
    repeats: 3,
});
```

### Particle System

3D Canvas includes a particle system meant for spell effects, the system is highly customizable but also very simple to use for basic projectiles.

#### No Scripting usage

<ImageButBetter src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1346839/168579424-7dd2436b-7503-46f4-8ea5-ff9a0925d610.png' alt='Automated Animations UI' className={styles.wikiimage} />
If you don't want to dig into the scripting aspect, the module [Automated Animations](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/autoanimations) provides a graphical interface to setup 3D Canvas Particle Effects.

#### Advanced usage

If you wish to use the particle system to it's full potential, you can create particle effects by using macros.
You can find the full documentation in the [Particles API Wiki Page](./levels-3d-preview/particles)

## Supported File Formats

<Tabs items={['3D File Formats', '2D File Formats', 'PBR Materials']}>
  <Tab>

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      Note that **FBX** support is getting phased out, since it's an inferior and outdated format compared to the new **GLTF** standard. It's suggested to use **GLB\GLTF** if possible.
    </Callout>

    You can use **`GLB`**, **`GLTF`** and **`FBX`** files, other formats can be easily converted. Blender is suggested to perform
    this operation.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    3D Canvas supports all the file formats supported by Foundry, including
    animated **`webm`** files. Due to how 3D Canvas handles transparency, semi-transparent images might be completely cut of by the processing.

    While the weather system supports animated file formats, the particle
    effect system does not.

    **Material Browser**
    <ImageButBetter
      src="/images/3D-Canvas/Material_Browser_Icon.png"
      alt="Material Browser Button"
      className={styles.wikiimage}
    />

    If you installed the 3D Canvas Mapmaking Pack, you will have access to more than 1000 Materials and the Material Browser.
    <ImageButBetter
      src="/images/3D-Canvas/Material_Browser.png"
      alt="Material Browser Interface"
      className={styles.wikiimage}
    />

    To access the material browser simply click the circular icon left of the [Filepicker+](Filepicker) icon (<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFileImport} />).


    You will then be welcomed by the material browser. To apply the material simply click on the desired one. Keep in mind that if you intend to use these materials on tokens, you need to select PBR in the material
    option.

    **Manually Loading a PBR Material**

    Tokens, walls, tiles and the scene table support PBR Materials. To load a pbr material you need a specific file naming stuctures. The files must be named as follows and be all in the same folder.

    ```postcss
    Wood077_1K_AmbientOcclusion.jpg
    Wood077_1K_Color.jpg
    Wood077_1K_Emissive.jpg
    Wood077_1K_Metalness.jpg
    Wood077_1K_NormalGL.jpg
    Wood077_1K_Roughness.jpg
    ```

    As you can see all the files share a root name then keywords to differentiate the different textures.

    You need to select one of the files in the image field to use them in 3D Canvas.

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
      For the full material to be loaded you can pick any of the images but _not_
      color, otherwise only the color texture will be used.
    </Callout>

    For walls you can load the image in it's texture field, same for tokens, tiles and the scene table. Tokens also require that the material is set to PBR.

    Displacement maps are not supported due to performance and optimization.

    _A guide by `@simulacrum`

    - Go to [HDRI to Cubemap by Matheowis](https://matheowis.github.io/HDRI-to-CubeMap/)
      - Upload you image. It doesn't take EXR so you'll have to convert those to HDRI, PNG or JPEG.
    - Once it's uploaded it will appear in the 3D view. You can now see how the Cube map will look.
    - It's possible to move the image by dragging on it but**don't**or it won't line up with your HDRI.
    - Adjust the Exposure. Make it darker.
    - The HDRI lights the cube map so you will have to compensate for this, either now or in your image editor later.
      - Choose Export and choose the bottom option export as PNG choosing the size you want for the individual sides
    - 2k is normally enough but you can try 4k if your machine can handle it or 1k if not
      - Click Process
      - Once it's finished, download them
    - The names of the files don't match up with 3D Canvas so use a file renamer to swap them.
    - Remember that your prefix must match on every file (i.e. **name_bk** , **name_ft** , etc.)
    - All the images will need to be flipped horizontally.
    - You will also have to rotate the **\_up** and **\_dn** images clockwise 90 degrees.
    - Altering the images in an editor like Photoshop or Gimp is recommended.
    - Save all of the files.
    - You can get the file size down by changing them to JPEG
    - Don't use much, if any, compression as it shows.
      webp looks very compressed so I don't use it.
      That's it. You now have an 8bit cube map that matches you 32 bit HDRI that will be a much smaller file size that the equivalent HDRI. Now you can use a 1k HDRI to give you the lighting and reflections and use the 8bit Cube Map as the background image.
