# Party HUD

<ModuleInfo/>

A system agnostic HUD that shows party members and their summons/companions in a neat and tidy manner. It also shows configurable stats and conditions for each member.

## How to use

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Only actors assigned to players will be available for selection! If you don't know what this means, see the [Assigning Player Characters](#assigning-player-characters) section.
</Callout>

The module requires [Carousel Combat Tracker](../free/carousel-combat-tracker) to be installed and enabled.
All the information for tooltips and resources is pulled and mirrored from the Carousel Combat Tracker Configuration.

- Hover over the HUD to show the buttons.
- Toggle the HUD on/off with the button on top of the HUD.
- Toggle the Scene Controls with the button on top of the HUD.
- Change the size of the HUD with the buttons on the bottom of the HUD.

### Configuration

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  By default the module will only show Connected Players. If you want to show all players, you need to disable the `Only Show Connected Players` option in the module settings.
</Callout>

The module has a few configuration options that can be found in the module settings.

You can customize the Images used for the edges of the HUD. Some images are included. Leave those fields blank to not display the border.
