ManifestURL](https://github.com/action-jay/potion-crafting-gathering/releases/latest/download/module.json)\!

## Creating a Gathering spot

<Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gatherersheetselect.png" alt="Selecting the Gatherer Sheet"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

Gatherer works with `Roll Tables`, so
before you start create a roll table and drag and drop the items you
want for your Gathering Spot in it. To create a gathering spot, follow
this steps.

- Create a new `Journal` and create a new `Text Journal Page` in it
  (or add a Text Journal Page in an existing Journal)
- In the Page header, click the `Sheet button` and in `This Sheet`
<Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gatherersheetfilled.png" alt="A Fully setup Gatherer Sheet"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>
  select `Gatherer Sheet`
- Select a Roll table from the drop down menu.
- Set the extra options you want, for this first tutorial we will use
  just the basics. We will give this gathering spot a 15 hours reset
  time and 10 draws (or pulls).
- The sheet should look like the one in the `A Fully setup Gatherer
Sheet` image
- `Note`: Due to a
  [Bug](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/8299) with the
  new V10 Journals, you might need to refresh the browser (F5) after
  your first setup of a Gatherer Sheet
- Once you saved and refreshed (if needed) your Journal Page should
  look like this when in view mode `Gatherer Sheet in View Mode` <Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gatherersview.png" alt="Gatherer Sheet in View Mode"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

You can now gather from this sheet, remember that you need either a
token selected or a character assigned to gather\!

As a GM you can manually reset a spot with the Reset button\!

## Options

You can configure multiple options for the Gatherer Sheet

### Time

Specify the time in hours after which the timer and draws are reset. For
example, a time of 48 will reset the spot every 2 days. You can use
decimal values.

### Draws

The number of Pulls that can be made from this spot. Draws\\Pulls will
reset automatically with time or when pressing the Reset button.

### Quantity

The amount of items that will be gathered from this spot. This value is
the same for all items and cannot be customized per item. If you wish to
change item chances, you can always weight the table differently.
Quantity also evaluates roll expressions. For example `1d6+3` and `3`
will both work.

If you want to set per-item quantities, see the Better Rolltables
integration section.

### Require

Specify item requirements for this gathering, the parameters can be a
comma separated list of item names. The actor doing the gathering will
need to have ALL the Required items if multiple are specified. Example `Fishing Rod,Bait`
<Image src="/images/Gatherer/Gathererminigame.png" alt="Gatherer Minigame"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

### Minigame

The minigame tag will let the user pick the item to gather instead of
leaving it to chance\! When using this tag, instead of a table roll, the
user will be prompted with a window with items appearing in a random
sequence, when the user clicks the button the currently displayed item
will be awarded\! The time is in milliseconds, e.g. `800`.

Remember that the time you chose is then multiplied by the chance an
item has to be drawn from the table, so for example, if an item has 20%
chance of being drawn, it's display timer will be `800ms*0.2 = 160ms` so
make sure to pick an appropriate amount of time\!

And remember, the more you wait to pick the item the faster the minigame
will get\!

Note: Leaving this field empty will disable the minigame and use
standard table rolling.

### Expression

A Macro expression that will be evaluated before the gathering. If the
expression resolves to `false`, a Pull will be consumed but no items
will be gathered. Example `const res = await actor.rollSkill("inv");
return res.total > 15;` will roll an investigation check, if the result
is higher than 16 the pull will succeed.

If you wish to cancel a gathering alltogether, return `null` instead and
no pulls will be consumed.

### Checks (DND5E Only)

For the DnD5e system, a dropdown with ability/skill checks and tool
checks are available with corresponding DC\! The tool name is Case
Sensitive\! Failing the check will result in a consumed Pull but no
rewards.

## Harvesting

You can gather resources from dead creatures!

- Open the creature actor sheet
- Click on the `Gatherer Button` on top
- Drag in a Gatherer Page
- Set a Pulls override (if you want)

Players will be able to gather resources from that token by pressing Shift + G while having the token Targeted.

### Configuration

In the game settings you can disable the harvesting feature, as well as set the resource path to check if the creature can be harvested (eg. is dead)

## Better Rolltables Integration

If you have the Better Rolltables module installed, and you set `Better
Tables Type` to `Better Table` you will be able to set a `formula` for
each item. In this instance, Gatherer will use that formula instead of
the quantity specified in the Gatherer Sheet.

## API
This section contains APIs for advanced users and developers.

### Hooks

#### gathererGather

The `gathererGather` hook, fires just before the items are gathered from the table. It receives the following parameters:

```js
/**
 * Object representing gathered data.
 * @typedef {Object} gathererData
 * @property {Actor} actor - The actor associated with the gathered data.
 * @property {Item[]} items - An array of items associated with the gathered data.
 * @property {number} quantity - The quantity of items in the gathered data.
 */
```

Example:

```js
Hooks.on("gathererGather", (gathererData) => {
    gathererData.quantity *= 2;
    gathererData.actor.update({ "data.attributes.hp.value": 0 });
    gathererData.items = gathererData.items.filter((item) => item.name !== "Rope");
});
```
