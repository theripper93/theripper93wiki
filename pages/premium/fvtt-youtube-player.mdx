## FAQ

### Can I hide the video?
No, the video is always visible to all players, hiding it is against Youtube's terms of service. The module can't support this feature.
Note that if you were to hide the video using CSS, the audio would still be played, so it's not a good solution.

### How do ADs work?
The module uses the youtube API to play videos, if the video has ADs, they will be played as well. If you are logged in in the same browser and you have Youtube Premium, the ADs will be skipped.
Note that ADs are handled indipendently for each user, so if a user has Youtube Premium and another doesn't, the ADs will be skipped only for the user with Premium.

Note that due to the fact that the module autoplays the video, it's possible that the ADs are not played at all. But this is not an intended feature.
