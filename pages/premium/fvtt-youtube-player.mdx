## FAQ

### Can I hide the video?
Unfortunately, hiding the video is not an option as it contravenes YouTube's terms of service. For this reason, the module does not accommodate this feature.

It's worth noting that attempting to hide the video using CSS would create a confusing user experience where audio is playing but no controls are present, rendering it an inadequate solution.

### How do ADs work?
The module utilizes the YouTube API to stream videos, which includes any accompanying advertisements. If the video contains ads, they will be displayed during playback. However, if you are logged into the same browser with a YouTube Premium subscription, ads will be automatically skipped.

It's important to understand that ad handling is user-specific. Therefore, if one user has YouTube Premium while another does not, ads will only be bypassed for the Premium user.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that since the module autoplays videos, there's a possibility that ads might not play at all. However, this is not an intended feature of the module.

## API

The module offers some classes you can use to customize the player if you wish to do so. Note that it's against YouTube's terms of service to hide the video, but you can customize other things such as it's border.


### Customizing the border for GMs and Players

.fvtt-youtube-player-is-gm-true{
