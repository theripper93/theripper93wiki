# RPG Damage Numbers

<ModuleInfo/>

Damage numbers, with style.

## How to use

The module will work out of the box with no configuration needed. Just install and go!

### Non-DnD5e Systems

If you are using a system other than DnD5e, you can still use RPG damage numbers, but it will only show a Red color for damage numbers or a Green color if a `+` is in front of the number.
