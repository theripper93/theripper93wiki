# RPG Damage Numbers

<ModuleInfo/>

Damage numbers, with style.

## How to use

### With Midi-QoL

<Image src="/images/RPG-Damage-Numbers/Rdnsettings.png" alt="Module Settings"   className={styles.wikiImage}/>

If you have Midi-QoL in use, RPG Damage Numbers will automatically show
colored damage numbers whenever a creature is damaged.

### Without Midi-QoL

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
Make sure that `Override Core Bouncing Text` is enabled in the module
settings
</Callout>
If you are not using Midi-QoL, RPG Damage numbers will still display
it's own custom animation for status effects and damage numbers, but
color will not be shown for different damage types.

### Non-DnD5e Systems

If you are using a system other than DnD5e, you can still use RPG damage numbers, but it will only show a Red color for damage numbers or a Green color if a `+` is in front of the number.
