### Customization

You can decide when the distance is shown (eg. only in combat) and other
smaller tweaks in the module settings.

### Measurements

Keep in mind that due to the calculation beeing not possible, if two
tokens are at a different elevation, the distance mesurement will be
switched from your preferred method to `Euclidean`

### Quick Movement

Hover the desired position and press `M` to move the selected token to that position or it's nearest free space.
