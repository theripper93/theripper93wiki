# Tidbits

<ModuleInfo/>

Automatically show helpful tips to your players when they join the game, during load screens and when the game is paused. Customize tips and loading screen images to your liking!

## How to use

The module will be ready to use from the get go, but you can head to the module settings to decide when to show tidbits, you can:

- Show tidbits when the game is paused in place of the "Paused" text
- Show tidbits while a scene is loading
- Show tidbits when a player joins the game as a whisper chat message

## Customization

### Customizing the loading screen images

To customize the loading screen images, simply point the corresponding setting to a folder containing your images. The module will automatically pick a random image from the folder to display.

### Customizing the tidbits

The tidbits can come from two sources:

- Included tidbits: tidbits that are included with the module, these are system specific, you can disable them by unchecking the `Use default sources` setting
- Custom tidbits: tidbits that you can add yourself, you can add them by pointing the corresponding `Custom Source` setting to a `.txt` or `.json` file

Tidbits support regular text as well as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

#### With a text file

In order to create a custom list of tidbits, simply create a `.txt` file containing your tidbits and point the corresponding setting to it. Each tidbit should be on a separate line.

Example:

```txt
This is a tidbit
This is another tidbit
This is a third tidbit
```

#### With a JSON file

When dealing with `.json` files, make sure to use double quotes (`"`) and not single quotes (`'`) and don't forget the commas! You can use [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your files.

In order to create a custom list of tidbits, simply create a `.json` file containing your tidbits and point the corresponding setting to it. The file should be formatted as follows:

```json
[
    "This is a tidbit",
    "This is another tidbit",
    "This is a third tidbit"
]
```
