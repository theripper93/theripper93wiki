When searching Spotlight Omnisearch will show first documents imported in your world, then it will show documents in compendiums

#### Special Actions

Some documents will have special actions, for example, Scenes will have Activate and View actions or Journal Entries will have actions to open specific pages.

#### Filtering

<Callout Callout type = 'info' emoji = 'ℹ️' >
    You don't need to type the full category name when filtering! For example, `!sc` will filter scenes without needing to type `!scene`.
</Callout>

When you search, you will see that each category of result is separated by a line which also contains it's header or category.
You can filter using those same words to only show results of that category. In order to filter, you can use the `!` character followed by the category name. For example, `!scene` will only show scenes.
