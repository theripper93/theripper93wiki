# Rich Info Tooltips

<ModuleInfo/>

Create sections of text that you can hover for more information. Chose between different themes and enchance your content.

## How to use

When you first start the module, or if the Jurnal is missing, a `Rich Info Tooltips` Jurnal will be created in your Jurnal list. You can move it to any folder you want but **do not rename it**.

- Add a new page to the `Rich Info Tooltips` Jurnal, in this example we will call it `Example`.
- Add whatever content you want to the page.
- Now you will be able to make an `Example` tooltip in any other rich text field.
- Use the syntax `@info[Example]` to create a tooltip that will show the content of the `Example` page on hover. This will work in:
    - Any rich text editor (Journals, Item Descriptions, etc.)
    - In Chat messages
