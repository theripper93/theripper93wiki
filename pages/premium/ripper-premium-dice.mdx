# Wave Dice

<ModuleInfo/>

A set of animated dice for Dice So Nice! These dice are exclusive to Supporter Patreons.

## How to use

- Enable the module
- Open you Dice so Nice settings
- Select one of the `Wave` dice options
- Use the `Wave - White` then set a color for custom colors

## Notes

These dice use a special rendering technique, if you apply white borders or text they will become transparent. You can use this to create cool borderless dice!
Of curse this also has the limitation of not beeing able to have dark dice with white borders or text.
