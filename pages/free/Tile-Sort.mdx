### Sorting Tiles

To sort the tiles, simply drag and drop in the list

### Hiding Tiles

Hovering over the image of the tile in the tile sort window an eye icon
will appear, clicking it will hide the tile until you close the tile
sort window or click the button again. This will allow you to work and
move tiles that are overlapping the hidden tile more easily.

### Opening the tile configuration

Double clicking a tile in the Tile Sort interface will open it's config,
this will allow you to open a tile configuration without moving other
tiles that could overlap it.

### Highlihting

Hovering over a tile in Tile Sort will create a colored highlight of the
tile that will make spotting overlapping tiles easier
