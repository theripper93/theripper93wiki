# Betters Roofs
<ModuleInfo/>
**Betters Roofs** is a module for enhancing Foundry's overhead tile
functionality.

## Required Modules

- [libWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper)

## Features

### Reveal in Fog

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Keep in mind that this settings works of the `Vision Range` of the token, if the token has no `Vision Range` or Vision disabled the roof will not show.
</Callout>

When this option is enabled, the full tile will be revealed in the Fog
of War and display as "explored". This features uses the image itself for detection,
so if your roof tile is completely enclosed in walls, the roof will not
be revealed. In the same way, if a roof is illuminated by a light it
will not be revealed.

Note: If you are using `Levels`, the `Top` of the tile needs to be set
to `Infinity` for the tile to count as a roof (**an this feature to
work**)

### Occlusion ID

This id is used to create "groups" of tiles, imagine it as a tag, it can
be any text you wish, such as "house-1-canopy"

### Occlusion Links

With Occlusion Link you can link the occlusion state of tiles.

A tile marked as Occlusion Link Source will set all the tiles with
matching Occlusion Link ID to its occluded state

For example, let's say you have trees that are overlapping with the roof
of a building, when you are inside the building and the roof is occluded
(not visible) you don't want the trees to be visible inside the house.
Simply assign the same occlusion link id to the trees and the roof, then
set the roof as occlusion link source. When the roof is occluded, the
trees outside will disappear as well. Keep in mind that if you were to
enable Occlusion link source on the trees as well, going under one tree
will make all trees and the roof occluded.

### Occlusion Radius

This token setting will determine the size of the revealed radius when a
token is under a tile with "Radial" occlusion mode.
