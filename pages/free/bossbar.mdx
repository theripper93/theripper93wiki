## Customization

You can customize the Boss Bar position and appearance in the module
settings. You can also use your own custom image.

### Pan to Boss

In the module settings you can also choose if you want the camera to
focus on the boss when you activate the Boss Bar for dramatic effect.

### Configuring Boss Bar for your system

Please refer to the same steps as [Splatter's configuration](./splatter#manually-configuring-splatter-for-your-system) as they are the same.
