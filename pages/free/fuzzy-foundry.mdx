Perform deep searches inside folder structures and sidebars and fuzzy searches on
compendiums and sidebars. The text in this journals contains the word

## Basics

### Searches

#### Deep Folder Search

<Image
  src='/images/Dig-Down/Ddtips.png'
  alt='Journal containing the word "Tips"'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
If enabled, it will allow you to search in subfolders while using the file picker.

For this feature to work you must enable `Deep File Search` in the
module settings then click the `Rebuild Cache` button in the settings
sidebar

If a directory contains a file called `noscan.txt`, then that directory will be excluded from the deep folder search.  This can be useful if you have a very large collection of files, and including all of them would use too much memory for the cache.

#### Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy Searches are done automatically. It will find the closest matches
to your search (e.g. searching for `accolite` will show `Acolyte` in the
results). They are enabled by default and will work for compendiums and
the actor sidebar.

#### Deep Search

<Image
  src='/images/Dig-Down/Ddcrsearch.png'
  alt='Search CR with deep search'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
The deep search starts with `&`. It will look into the items to find a property or
value that matches the search. For example: Searching for the name of an image will
filter for any entity that is using that image.

Note that this feature works on all sidebar directories and will search
inside the JSON itself. If you are looking for a scene with zombies you
can search in your scene sidebar for `&zombie`.

#### Prop Search

  Prop Search may be slow for huge directories.
</Callout>

Starting a search with `!` will search in the properties defined in the
settings.

If `data.details.cr` is a property defined in the settings, searching for
`!1` will filter for creatures with a cr of 1.

image field.
