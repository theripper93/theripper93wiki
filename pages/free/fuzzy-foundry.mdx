## Basics

### Searches

#### Deep Folder Search

<Image
  src='/images/Dig-Down/Ddtips.png'
  alt='Journal containing the word "Tips"'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiimagesmall}
/>
If enabled, it will allow you to search in subfolders while using the file picker.

For this feature to work you must enable `Deep File Search` in the
module settings then click the `Rebuild Cache` button in the settings
sidebar

#### Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy Searches are done automatically. It will find the closest matches
to your search (e.g. searching for `accolite` will show `Acolyte` in the
results). They are enabled by default and will work for compendiums and
the actor sidebar.

#### Deep Search

<Image

  alt='Search CR with deep search'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiimagesmall}
/>
The deep search starts with `&`. It will look into the items to find a property or
value that matches the search. For example: Searching for the name of an image will
filter for any entity that is using that image.

Note that this feature works on all sidebar directories and will search
inside the JSON itself. If you are looking for a scene with zombies you
can search in your scene sidebar for `&zombie`.

#### Prop Search

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  Prop Search may be slow for huge directories.
</Callout>

Starting a search with `!` will search in the properties defined in the
settings.

If `data.details.cr` is a property defined in the settings, searching for
`!1` will filter for creatures with a cr of 1.
