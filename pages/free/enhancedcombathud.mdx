A Solasta
inspired HUD to make your games easier for your players and for teaching
new players without a hitch. Compatible with multiple systems.

Note that Dungeons & Dragons 5e is the only `First Party` supported system, other systems are supported by the community.
This page includes some general information about the module as well as information about the D&D 5e system version.
Note that other systems may have different features and/or different ways of using the module.

  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
To open the HUD, click the
crossed swords icon in the token controls (top left buttons) or click
the same button in the token hud (right click on a token).
You can also use the keybind SHIFT+A to toggle the hud.


### Target Picker

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  In order for players to target using the Left mouse button, you'll need to install the [Smart Target](./smarttarget) module.
As an alternative, players can still use the T key to target.
</Callout>

When this feature is enabled, whenever you click on an action in the HUD, you will be prompted with a target selection mode.
While in target selection:

 - The number of Selected/Required targets will follow your cursor
 - Left click (or T) to target a token
 - Right click to cancel target selection
 - Click `+` or `-` to increase/decrease the number of maximum targets manually


 ### Macros

 You can use the Argon API to toggle the HUD, you can do so with the following macro:

 ```js
 ui.ARGON.toggle()
  ```

## Dungeons & Dragons 5e

### Spells

Expanding the spells panel will show you how many maximum and remaining
spell slots you have for each level. You can customize visibility of
prepared spells in the module settings.

### Action Tracking

Argon provides a basic action tracking, there is no option to undo or
manually change the tracking, opening and closing the hud will reset the
action tracking. The action tracking will **not** prevent you from using
actions.

### Save/Skills/Tools

<Image

  alt='A screenshot of the weapon sets menu'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>

This panel provides easy access to the respective checks and tools.

### Weapon Sets

Above the portrait are 3 sets of 2 boxes. The left boxes represents the
action and the right boxes represents bonus actions.

NPCs will have their sets created automatically. For PCs simply drag &
drop items from the character sheet to the weapon sets boxes.

  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
To remove an item drag it from the weapon sets box to the character
portrait (a trash can will appear). Weapon sets are not limited to
weapons, for example a caster could use it for frequently used cantrips.

By default switching sets will also equip or unequip the items.

### Movement Tracker

A basic movement tracker will track remaining squares of movement during
<Image
  src='/images/Argon/Argontooltips.png'
  alt='Tooltips'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
a round. The tracker will turn yellow when getting to dash and turn red
when it's exceeded (the third red bar could be used for the rogue double
dash as well)

### Tooltips

Tooltips provide useful information on the items, you can change which
tooltips are shown (including no tooltips) in the module settings, these
are client side settings.

## For Developers

### Argon SYSTEM module specifications

To streamline detecting and directing users, there should be an agreed upon naming scheme for the system specific modules:

- Module `id`: `enhancedcombathud-systemid`
- Module `title`: `Argon - Combat HUD (SYSTEMID)`

Where one is lowercase and the other is upper case.

Example, for the DnD5e module, it should be `id: enhancedcombathud-dnd5e` `title: Argon - Combat HUD (DND5E)`

## FAQs

### Can you add compatibility for X system?

System other than D&D 5e are supported by the community, you can try asking in your system's discord server or channel if someone is willing to add support for it.
If you are a developer and want to add support for a system, feel free to contact me on discord for help. You can also use any of the existing systems as a template.
