A Solasta
inspired HUD to make your games easier for your players and for teaching
new players without a hitch. It is only D&D 5e compatible.

## Basics

### Opening the HUD

  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
To open the HUD, click the
crossed swords icon in the token controls (top left buttons) or click
the same button in the token hud (right click on a token). A macro is
also included to toggle the hud.

### Spells

Expanding the spells panel will show you how many maximum and remaining
spell slots you have for each level. You can customize visibility of
prepared spells in the module settings.

### Action Tracking

Argon provides a basic action tracking, there is no option to undo or
manually change the tracking, opening and closing the hud will reset the
action tracking. The action tracking will **not** prevent you from using
actions.

### Save/Skills/Tools

  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>

This panel provides easy access to the respective checks and tools.

### Weapon Sets

Above the portrait are 3 sets of 2 boxes. The left boxes represents the
action and the right boxes represents bonus actions.

NPCs will have their sets created automatically. For PCs simply drag &
drop items from the character sheet to the weapon sets boxes.

To remove an item drag it from the weapon sets box to the character
portrait (a trash can will appear). Weapon sets are not limited to
weapons, for example a caster could use it for frequently used cantrips.

By default switching sets will also equip or unequip the items.

### Movement Tracker

A basic movement tracker will track remaining squares of movement during
<Image

  alt='Tooltips'
  
  
  className={styles.wikiImageSmall}
/>
a round. The tracker will turn yellow when getting to dash and turn red
when it's exceeded (the third red bar could be used for the rogue double
dash as well)

### Tooltips

Tooltips provide useful information on the items, you can change which
tooltips are shown (including no tooltips) in the module settings, these
are client side settings.

### Target Picker

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️'>
  In order for players to target using the Left mouse button, you'll need to install the [Smart Target](./smarttarget) module.
As an alternative, players can still use the T key to target.
</Callout>

When this feature is enabled, whenever you click on an action in the HUD, you will be prompted with a target selection mode.
While in target selection:

 - The number of Selected/Required targets will follow your cursor
 - Left click (or T) to target a token
 - Right click to cancel target selection
 - Click `+` or `-` to increase/decrease the number of maximum targets manually


 ### Macros

 You can use the Argon API to toggle the HUD, you can do so with the following macro:

 ```js
 ui.ARGON.toggle()
  ```

## Common Issues

Argon was made
for Chrome. If you experience weird UI issues, consider switching
browsers.

### Portraits not showing

If your image path has parenthesis "(" or ")" the image will fail to
load, this might be true for other special characters as well


## FAQs

### Can you add compatibility for X system?

No, Argon is hardcoded for dnd5e. If you want you can make a fork for a
specific system. You have to include the licence section and credit the
original authors (**theripper93**, **Mouse0270**) and include links to our
patreon page\website (if provided).

### Why is xyz type of item not in the HUD?

We had to make a choice on what to include, anything that's not on those
categories is not included (a 1 minute cast time spell for example, or a
consumable that is used as bonus action). Those items will not be added.
You can use Sets for any item.

### Why the items in the HUD are not updating correctly?

Only a select number of elements are dynamically updated. To manually
update the HUD simply close and reopen the Argon HUD.
