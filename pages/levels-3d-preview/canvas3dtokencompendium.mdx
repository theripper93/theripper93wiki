# 3D Canvas Token Collection
<ModuleInfo/>
A Collection of 3D Miniatures ready to use in 3D Canvas. Includes 2000+ non colored miniatures of heroes and monsters, and 200+ colorized miniatures.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Not Limited to 3D! Every 3D Model includes a 2D Portrait you can use for both Actors and Tokens as well as a 2D Top Down Token. So, even if you are not using 3D Canvas you can get a great collection of 500+ 2D Tokens and Portraits.
</Callout>

Note that 2D Top-Down tokens will need to be scaled gnerally to 2x to be of a resonable size. This is due to the automated process used to generate them.
