This\ntutorial assumes you have a standard grid size of 5ft, if that is\nnot the case adjust the Levels size accordingly (usually 2 times the\nsize of 1 square). Setting a background is not strictly required and\nyou can use a blank map if you prefer.\nOpen the Levels UI (also known as the Levels Layer Tool) by\npressing the  button.\nPress the  button to go into edit mode, extend\nthe window vertically to have some extra space\nPress the  button two times to add two levels.\nSet the bottom one at 0/10 elevation and the top one at 10/20.

Giving a name to your\nLevels is not strictly required.\nHead out of edit mode by pressing the button again and select the\n0/10 Level by clicking on it. Your UI should now match the Levels UI\nscreenshot below.\nWhile you have a Level selected in the UI, anything you place will\nbe placed on that Level. Now head to the Tiles Layer.\nOpen the Tile Browser and navigate to\nmodules/levels/sample-maps/baileywiki/, drag and drop the\nbarn-lvl1.webp file onto the scene.\nHead to the Walls Layer and wall this ground floor tile\nappropriately.\nNow select the First Floor (10/20) in the Levels UI. In the Tile\nBrowser grab the barn-lvl2.webp file from the same folder and\ndrag it on top of the other tile aligning them correctly. As\nbefore, head to the Walls Layer and wall this floor\nappropriately.\nWe will enable an additional settings on this floor so we can see it\nwhen we are on the Ground Floor.

Toggle the Roof View/Placement\noff, and on the ground floor head to the Drawings Layer\nPlace a square drawing where the ladder is located on the top of the\nbarn. This will create a stair.\nDone! Place a token and move around to explore the barn.\n\n\nRemember to use Tokens with vision and have vision enabled in the scene\nsettings!\nFeel free to play with multiple tokens (selecting one at\na time) to see how floors block vision.While we don't have stairs to connect us to the roofs,\nyou can manually change the elevation of your tokens to 10 or 20 to explore them.Maybe experiment by creating your own star connections to the roofs!","basics#Basics":"When using Levels it's important to understand the concept of Wall Height's\nToken Height make sure to read the\ndocumentation about it before using Levels.","levels-ui#Levels UI":"Open the Levels UI (also known as the Levels Layer Tool) by pressing the  button.You will see a small semi-transparent black box open in the top-right of\nFoundry.Layers can be manually created with the  button on the\nbottom of the row or automatically generated from entities with\nelevation values with the  button on the bottom row.While the Levels UI is open, the view will show all tiles and entities\nin the elevation range of the layer. Any tiles or tokens added to the\nscene while on a layer in the UI will automatically set the tile or\ntoken to its height.To rename or change the elevation values of a layer, press the button. You will now be in edit mode for\nthe Levels UI window. Click on the layer you wish to edit, then modify the name or\nvalues. The downwards arrow represents the lowest elevation and the upwards arrow\nrepresents the highest for the layer. Click the button again to confirm and save\nyour edit.There are 3 additional toggles at the leftmost of the bottom row: Show Players in the UIShows icons of the players in the UI, the icons will be placed in the\ncorresponding level. You can click the icons to select the corresponding\nplayer. Place Drawings as StairsWhile toggled on, place drawings as stairs, toggle it off to create\nlabels or descriptions to place in your levels. Enable Levels Roofs View/PlacementDisplays roofs above the current level. Placing tiles while this toggle\nis active will place them as roofs above the current level. Place Tiles as Overhead Tiles Inside the Current\nLevelTiles placed with this toggle active will be placed as overhead tiles\ninside the level. For example you could use this to place a chandelier\ninside the current level.To view every tile and token or exit the layers view, close the Levels\nUI. You can also clear all levels layers with the\nbutton. This will not delete tiles or tokens.If you create a drawing while the Levels UI is active, the drawing will\nbe set automatically as a Stair and it will be set as Hidden. The Stair\nwill be configured to move you from the current Level to the one above\nit and vice versa.The Levels UI is a tool to help you place and visualize your Levels\nsetup. Levels does not require levels in the UI to be defined to work,\nfor example if you deleted all your levels in the UI after building your\nmap, the map will still work exactly the same. Removing levels from the\nUI or changing their range will not modify or remove entities in the\nscene.","tiles#Tiles":"Tiles are a core aspect of Levels. Every tile can be assigned an\nelevation and sight is based on tile transparency.It is generally recommended for Levels tiles to be overhead tiles. Tiles\nnot set as overhead will all be placed at the background elevation.The background is counted as a solid plane (i.e. a single overhead tile\nat a defined elevation) with a default elevation of 0. The elevation of\nthe background can be adjusted in scene settings. Keep in mind that the\nbackground layer and it's tiles will not account for transparency and\nwill count instead as a solid scene sized plane.","tokens#Tokens":"Token height is handled by Wall Height.\nIt's highly suggested to read the Token Height section of the Wall Height page\nbefore using Levels.","drawings#Drawings":"In Levels, drawings are used to create stairs and elevators. Their purpose is to\nallow travel between elevations. However, how they handle travel between elevations\nis handled differently.To create or edit a stair or elevator, double click on an existing\ndrawing to open the drawing configuration menu.You will see a few settings added by Levels.Levels Drawing Mode determines the purpose of the drawing. None\ntreats it as a vanilla Foundry drawing, Stair sets it as a stair, and\nElevator sets it as an elevator.One Way Stairs follow the same rules as regular Stairs but work only\nOne WayBefore V10, there was the Hole option as well. However, holes have\nbeen deprecated from V10 onwards in favour of tile transparency.Elevator Floors set the floors an elevator can transport entities\nbetween. The syntax for it is elevation,name|elevation,name (e.g.\n0,Ground Floor|10, First Floor).Height (Top) sets the top height (i.e. highest point) of the drawing.Height (Bottom) sets the bottom height (i.e. lowest point) of the\ndrawing.","stairs#Stairs":"Stairs allow tokens to travel from and to two set elevations.\nStairs can only move tokens to its set elevations\nThe token must be on one of the two elevations exactly (e.g. 0 or 10) to trigger\nStairs will move tokens one value higher than its top elevation if\nentering from below\n\nFor example: a stair with a bottom of 0 and a top of 9. A token at an elevation\nof 0 that enters the stair will now have an elevation of 10.\nIf they re-enter the stair while at an elevation of 10, they will then have an\nelevation of 0. Any other elevation will not trigger the Stair.","one-way-stairs#One Way Stairs":"One way stairs function the same way as regular stairs but don't allow\ntwo-way movement.For example: a one way stair with a bottom of 0 and a top of 9.\nIf set to One Way - Down will bring any token that enters it while at an\nelevation of 10 to 0,\nand entering with an elevation of 0 will do nothing. One Way - Up will do the opposite","elevators#Elevators":"Elevators allow tokens to travel between multiple set elevations.Tokens that enter an elevator can freely travel between the elevations\nset in Elevator Floors via a pop-up menu.Elevators will trigger on any elevation in the range of the drawing. For\nexample an elevator set to 0 / 40 as it's top and bottom values will\ntrigger on any elevation between those (e.g. 25). The options you define\nin the elevator don't affect the triggering range.","vision#Vision":"Levels heavily relies on vision. If vision is disabled on the map or you have\nselected a token without vision, you might experience undesired effects!\n\n\nToken vision is best understood three dimensionally ala our own physical world.Imagine 3 tokens. Let's call them Token A, B, and C. Token\nA is on top of a tower that is 60 units high. Tokens B and C\nare at an elevation of 0.However, Token B is 60 (horizontal) units away from Token A and\nToken C is 10 (horizontal) units away from Token A.Token A can see farther outwards than Tokens B and C because\nit is viewing from a higher vantage point. It will also be able to look\nover any tiles at an elevation of less than 60. In addition, Token A\nand Token B can see each other.However, Token A and Token C cannot see each other. This is\nbecause the line of sight between Token B and Token C is blocked\nby the tower. If Token C moves farther away from Token A and the\ntower, then the two tokens will be visible to each other.","fog-of-war--advanced-fog-exploration#Fog of War & Advanced Fog Exploration":"Fog in foundry is unidimensional, the system itself is not build to\nhandle multiple layers of fog, for that reason, by default, if you\nexplored any elevation, all areas in that zone (independent of\nelevation) will also be explored. For example if a player explored a\nfirst floor of a building then went to the second floor, it would be\nalready fully explored.Since the only way to make it work correctly would be to completely\nrewrite the fog exploration system and even then there would be issues\nof storing multiple fogs (as it would take up load time on startup).\nOutside of this problem there would be even more issues because 'fog\nlayers' could not be completely separate as exploring an area open to\nthe sky would make it dark once you changed elevation.Due to all this issues that currently have no solution levels implements\nwhat's called 'Advanced Fog Exploration'.What this does is simple, when a player is in the elevation range of a\ntile, levels imposes a black shape of that tile onto the fog layer which\nbasically means that it disables fog exploration for that tile only.Unfortunately there is no solution currently to solve this problem.This is enabled by default, but you can globally disable it or even\ntoggle it per tile.","settings#Settings":"","scene-settings#Scene Settings":"","dont-disable-lights#Don't disable lights":"Due to V11 changes that locked down some APIs and Methods, the old Light Masking is no longer working as of V11.\nThe setting has been replaced with a new Don't disable lights setting.\nIf you don't wish to read below or you find it confusing, the short version is: In scenes that use Levels, you should disable this setting, otherwise leave it as is (enabled by default).\n\nIn this example the lighting looks correct at first glance. Don't disable lights can\nbe toggled in the Lighting tab in the scene settings. By enabling this feature\nall lights will be visible and pass through all levels.Disabling this setting will only show lights on the current level. Here we can\nsee, by moving the roof slightly, that while the roof is covering the \"green\"\ncoloration of the light, the vision portion of the light is still visible.\n\n\nWith this option enabled, lights will be visible and pass through all\nlevels.\nWhile this visual \"glitch\" will reveal the map in those locations,\nit will not reveal tokens.","weather-elevation#Weather Elevation":"Elevation for weather can be adjusted","background-elevation#Background Elevation":"You can set the elevation for the background layer in the scene\nsettings. Default is 0.Keep in mind that due to limitations and performance issues, the whole\nBackground layer will disregard any transparency vision calculations,\nand count as a scene-sized vision blocking plane.Example: If you make a blank new scene with no tiles or background\nimage, then place a token at 0 elevation and one at -10 you will notice\nthat they cannot see each other.This works well for most use cases (e.g. have your map as the background\nof the scene, then add floors above and\\or basements below) but might\nbe a problem in some specific scenes that require transparency at 0\nelevation.In these cases, simply set the Background Elevation to an arbitrary\nlarge negative number (e.g. -99999), ignore the background layer and just\nuse overhead tiles placed through the Levels UI. For example, after\ncreating your scene with your background image (so that the scene is\nauto sized properly) remove the background image from the scene\nconfiguration and set the background elevation to -99999. Then place\nyour \"background\" image through the Levels UI at 0 elevation.","handling-multiple-tokens#Handling Multiple Tokens":"When having multiple tokens selected, Levels needs to decide a single\npoint of view, for this reason, multiple tokens handling is not\nsupported.While having multiple tokens selected will still merge their vision,\nLevels will not be able to decide which floor to show if the tokens are\nat different elevations. At the moment there is no solution to this so\nstick with one selected token at a time if you have multiple at\ndifferent elevations.","api#API":"The API is available for viewing by entering CONFIG.Levels.API in the Foundry\nconsole or in API.js.While most APIs are developer focused, there are a few that can be used by users listed below.","rescaling-grid-distance#Rescaling grid distance":"This API can be used when changing the grid distance for the scene (for example changing each square from 5ft to 1.5m)\nThe number passed to the function is the old grid distance.\nCONFIG.Levels.API.rescaleGridDistance(5)","hooks#Hooks":"levelsInit(levelsConfig)A hook that fires when levels has finished initializing, you should use\nthis hook if you want to subclass/wrap/override the levels handlers\nlevelsConfig.handlers.

If the issue is not fixed, enaable Levels, then offset all the walls on each layer by a small amount so that their end points don't overlap with other walls on other levels.\nI'm currently in contact with the developer that wrote the wall optimization algorithm to see if there is a way to fix this issue.","foundry-v9-to-v10-changes#Foundry V9 to V10 Changes":"","changes#Changes":"Polygons and holes are deprecated\nLevels will now automatically handle visibility based on the\ntile transparency.

It operates the same way as a 2D Image field.","dynamic-mesh#Dynamic Mesh":"The Dynamic Mesh option is a very powerful tool, it allows you to generate 3D Models on the fly, depending on how you configure it.\nThe Dynamic Mesh Resolution option allows you to specify how complex the generated geometry will be, the higher the number, the more complex the geometry will be, but also the more performance it will take to render.","dynamic-mesh-types#Dynamic Mesh Types":"If the option is set to anything other than None (use 3d model) the 3D Model field will be ignored.","basic-shapes#Basic shapes":"These options will create basic shapes, these include Box, Sphere, Dome, Cylinder, Tube, Cone.\nThey all operate in the same way, as in they will create a basic shape that you can then customize with other settings.\nThis is the most basic usage of the Dynamic Mesh option, an example usage of this would be to create a Box, set it to a blue color (or apply a texture) and enable the Ocean Shader. In a matter of seconds you created a lake, river or ocean for your scene.","billboard#Billboard":"The Billboard and Billboard (cross) options will a model which is a combination of multiple (2 or 3) planes, this is especially usefull to create vegetation that is very cheap to render.\nThis option is often used in combination with the repeat mode (discussed below) to create a forest or a field of grass.","text#Text":"The Text option will create a 3D Model that is a text, this is usefull to create signs or labels for your scene.\nAfter selecting the Text option, you can input your text in the 3D Model field (since the text is the 3D Model).","map-generator#Map Generator":"This is by far the most versatile option. After selecting the Map Generator option, a Cog button will appear to the right of the Dynamic Mesh dropdown, after clicking it you will be presented with a new window, this window allows you to configure the Map Generator to your liking.\nSince this can be intimidating at first, you can watch a video tutorial on how to use it here as it offers a more visual explanation.","material-customization#Material Customization":"This section will include all the settings that allow you to customize the material of the 3D Model and will cover the options from Texture all the way down to Sides","texture#Texture":"The Texture option allows you to apply a texture to the 3D Model, this is the most basic way to customize the material of the 3D Model.\nYou can ether select a single texture or a full material using the Material Browser provided by the Mapmaking Pack module.The Texture Repeat slider allows you to set how many times the texture will repeat on the 3D Model.The Flip Y option will flip the texture on the Y axis, this is usefull if your texture is rendered upside down but in general you can ingore this setting.The Tint Color option allows you to set a color that will be applied to the texture, this is usefull to get more milage out of a single texture.","heightmapheatmap#Heightmap/Heatmap":"The Heightmap option allows you to apply a heightmap to the 3D Model, this will displace the geometry depending on the black\\white intensity of the image.\nSome heighmaps are included in the Mapmaking Pack module, but you can also use any image you want.You can set the intensity or invert the heightmap using the Heightmap Intensity and Invert Heightmap options.If your tile is in Repeat mode, the hightmap will be used as a Heatmap instead. A heatmap describes the density of distribution when using the Repeat mode, the darker the pixel, the more likely it is to spawn a 3D Model.","other-material-options#Other Material Options":"The rest of the options will let you customize the appearance of the material further.\nThe Roughness option will set the roughness of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less shiny.\nThe Reflectivity option will set the metalness of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less reflective.\nThe Opacity option will set the opacity of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less transparent.\nThe Shading option will set the shading of the material, this is usefull to make the material look more or less smooth.\nThe Sides option will set the sides of the material, generally this should be correct by default, but if you are using (for example) a dynamesh cylinder you will not see the 3D Model when looking at it from the insde. In this situation you might want to change this option to \"Double side\"","positioning#Positioning":"The Positioning section will allow you to customize the position of the 3D Model. You shouln't need to change any of these settings by changing them manually but they are exposed for advanced users.The Auto Center and Auto Ground option will automatically center and ground the 3D Model, this is usefull if you are using a 3D Model that is not centered or not on the ground by default. The Auto Ground option is enabled by default.The Tilt X and Tilt Y options will tilt the 3D Model on the X and Y axis.The Depth option is the 3D Counterpart of the Width and Height options in the regular tile settings, it will set the depth of the 3D Model.","animation#Animation":"The Animation section will allow you to enable and select animations for the 3D Model.The Enable Animation option will enable or disable the animation of the 3D Model.The Animation Index option will allow you to select the animation that will be played by the 3D Model if more than one is present.The Animation Speed option will allow you to set the speed of the animation.The Paused option will allow you to pause the animation (this is also accessible in the Tile HUD).","random-seed#Random Seed":"The Random Seed option is used by the Repeat mode and the Terrain generation, you can change this value to whatever you want to re-randomize.","vision#Vision":"The Vision section will allow you to customize how the 3D Model will interact with sight and collisions.\nThe Block Movement option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will block movement, disabling this option will let tokens pass through it. An obvious usecase would be disabling this on Grass.\nThe Block Sight option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will block sight. It's recommended to disable this option on any tile that does not requires it as it will improve performance. Things like grass, trees, or even floors don't need to block sight!\nThe Camera Collider option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will prevent the camera from going through it, this is only relevant if Game Camera is enabled.\nThe is Door option will allow you to set if the 3D Model will be treated as a door, this will allow you to open and close it with the regular Foundry interactions (Left click to open\\close, right click to Lock\\Unlock). A secret door can only be opened by a GM.\nThe Door State option will allow you to set the initial state of the door, this is only relevant if the is Door option is enabled.","tiling#Tiling":"The Tiling section will allow you make multiple copies of the same 3D Model in a single tile, this is usefull for things like grass or trees.\nUsing the Repeat mode is a lot more efficient than copy pasting the same 3D Tile multiple times.Once you set the Fill Type to Repeat you will be able to set the randomization options. The randomization options are self explanatory and will not be covered here.","shaders#Shaders":"The Shaders section will allow you to customize special effects on the 3D Model. The shader configuration is covered in the Shaders page as it's shared between multiple entities.","terrain#Terrain":"The Terrain section will allow you to generate a terrain using the 3D Model as a base. It's suggested to use a Dynamic Mesh basic shape for this.After selecting a Noise Type you will be able to set all the options for the noise. There are many noise options and the best way to understand them is to play with them.","merging-3d-tiles#Merging 3D Tiles":"It's very common to have multiple 3D Tiles that use the same model and texture that you need to manually place one by one instead of relying on the randomized Repeat mode.\nAs discussed above, having multiple 3D Tiles is not efficient and will slow down your game, luckly 3D Canvas will let you merge multiple 3D Tiles into a single one.To merge 3D Tiles, select multiple 3D Tiles and click the Merge button in the 3D Tile HUD. The button can be accessed by right clicking one of the selected tiles to bring up the HUD.\n3D Canvas will automatically figure out which of the selected tiles can be merged and will group them accordingly. The previously multi-copy tiles will be replaced by single merged tiles that are considerably more efficient.To un-merge a 3D Tile, select it and click the Unmerge button in the Tile HUD.\nUn-merging a tile will restore the original tiles to their previous position, rotation and scale before merging.","auto-merging#Auto Merging":"Any bulk/automated operation can inherently be dangerous, please make sure to make a duplicate of your scene before using this feature.\n3D Canvas offers a macro that will automatically optimize your scene by merging all the tiles that can be merged.\nThis operation will skip any currently selected tile and all door tiles even if they could be merged.You can find this macro in the 3D Canvas Macros compendium and it's named Auto Merge All Tiles.","advanced#Advanced":"","making-a-multilevel-3d-map#Making a Multilevel 3D Map":"For this to work, first enable the \"Mirror Levels Tile Visibility\" in the 3D Tab in your Scene Configuration.\nIf you wish to make a multilevel 3D Map, where the 3D Objects above you are not visible, Open the Levels UI and define the amount of levels you wish, then, select a level.\nA Magenta colored Plane will appear, to indicate where you are building, start draging and dropping 3D Object onto that plane to build on that level, repeat for the other levels.\nIf you now explore the map with a token selected, you will see that Objects above you will be hidden.","tagging-3d-models-with-collision-and-door-data-blender#Tagging 3D Models with Collision and Door data (Blender)":"You can add metadata to your 3D Models in a way that 3D Canvas will be able to read it and automatically make parts of your Mesh Doors or set collision\\sight blocking on submeshes separetly\nSelect the mesh you wish to tag\nHead to the 'Object Properties' tab and scroll to the bottom, Expand 'Custom Properties' and add them as needed (list of supported properties below)\nWhen you are done tagging all your meshes export the file as GLTF/GLB and make sure to include the custom properties in the export\n\n\n\nThe property names are case sensitive!\nProperty Name\tType\tValue\tcollision\tInteger\t0/1\tsight\tInteger\t0/1\tisDoor\tInteger\t0/1/2\tdoorId\tString\tAny Unique Name\tds\tInteger\t0/1/2\n\n\nSetting collision and sight will tell 3D Canvas whether to block these 'senses', for example you would set on solid meshes both 'collision' and 'sight' to 1, while on a window 'collision' to 1 and 'sight' to 0. If you had an ethereal wall for example, you would set both to 0 or 'collision' to 0 and 'sight' to 1.Note: You don't need to set collision and sight on all of your meshes. If the data is missing, 3D Canvas will use what is set globally on the tile (by default 1\\1)\n\nIn order for 3D Canvas to recognize and process a door correctly, any door you want to tag must have 'isDoor' set to 1 and a 'doorId' of your choice (eg \"Tavern_Door_A\". Keep in mind that every doorId must be different (no duplicate Ids)The 'ds' property tells 3D Canvas the Door State: 0 - Open, 1 - Closed, 2 - Closed and Locked\nThe 'isDoor' property tells 3D Canvas which type of door the door is: 0 - Not a Door, 1 - Regular Door, 2 - Secret Door","2d-tiles#2D Tiles":"Tiles are placed at the bottom elevation set through the Levels module.

If you want you can skip directly to the Modules section.","why-not-use-module-x#Why not use module X?":"If you are asking, why are you not using module X? The answer is that I carefully select the modules. Generally i follow this rules:\nDo I really need this module or does it add a very minor convinience I can live without? (I try to keep the number of modules to a minimum)\nIs this module stable and well maintained? (I check the github repo and the issues)\nIs this module compatible with the other modules I use? (I check the module documentation and the issues)\nWill this module be essential to run my game if I decide to use it? (I try to avoid modules that are essential to run my game unless they are from a trusted developer, I prefer to use modules that add convinience or improve the experience)\n\nFor these reasons you won't see any newly released modules in my list, I prefer to wait for them to mature a bit before adding them to my list, unless the module is from a developer I trust (because I have other modules from them in my list).Note: This is not a dig at developers that release new modules, nor at developers that don't have the time to maintain their modules since most do it for free. Since I like to be on the latest FVTT version I want to make sure that modules won't prevent me from updating.","how-many-modules-should-i-use#How many modules should I use?":"There is no exact magic number of modules, but the more you have, the more issues you might experience.

If the answer is no, remove it.\nGo through your list of modules a second time, and ask yourself How frequently do I use this module's functionality? How much time does it save?. If you find out that you don't use it that often, remove it.\nDouble check any modules that you feel are critical for your game. Check when they were last updated and if they are currently mantained. If they are not, consider removing them and changing your workflow now instead of suffering a bigger headache later.\nDo you have any modules the have a ton of functionality but you only use a small part of it? Consider removing it and replacing it with a smaller module that does only what you need.\nDo you have multiple modules that do the same thing? Or do you have multiple modules that tweak the same aspect of FVTT? For each overlap, chose one module and remove the others.\n\nAfter this cleanup, test out your game and see if there is anything you miss.
